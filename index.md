I am postdoctoral researcher in the division of Sociology, Social Policy and Social Research at the University of Fribourg, and senior researcher at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU). Befor that, I was (LIS)2ER Tony Atkinson Research Fellow at the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-economic Research (LISER) and the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) where I have contributed to strengthening the integration of research on social stratification, education, and the labour market within the institutesâ€™ research agendas.

In my research, I focus on social inequality, its dynamics across time and contexts, and its underlying mechanisms, with a particular emphasis on (higher) education and labour market outcomes. I am, among other things, analysing the financial stratification in European higher education systems, gender-specific education premiums in Varietes of Capitalism, and the impact of the Bologna process on the returns to higher education. Moreover, I am co-Principal Investigator in the MOBILITYPATH project, analysing social mobility in Austria from a multidimensional and spatial perspective.

I teach Sociology of Education and Work at the BA, and quantitative methods at the MA level.
