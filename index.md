I am postdoctoral researcher in the division of Sociology, Social Policy and Social Research at the <a href="https://www.unifr.ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Fribourg</a>, and senior researcher at the <a href="https://www.wu.ac.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)</a>. Befor that, I was (LIS)2ER Tony Atkinson Research Fellow at the <a href = "https://www.liser.lu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Luxembourg Institute of Socio-economic Research (LISER)</a> and the <a href = "https://www.lisdatacenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) </a> where I have contributed to strengthening the integration of research on social stratification, education, and the labour market within the institutesâ€™ research agendas.

In my research, I focus on social inequality, its dynamics across time and contexts, and its underlying mechanisms, with a particular emphasis on (higher) education and labour market outcomes. I am, among other things, analysing the financial stratification in European higher education systems, gender-specific education premiums in Varietes of Capitalism, and the impact of the Bologna process on the returns to higher education. Moreover, I am co-Principal Investigator in the MOBILITYPATH project, analysing social mobility in Austria from a multidimensional and spatial perspective.

I teach Sociology of Education and Work at the BA, and quantitative methods at the MA level.
